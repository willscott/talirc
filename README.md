Talirc
========

Talirc is an IRC shim for [Talek](https://github.com/privacylab/talek).

It runs as a local IRC server, which transforms IRC messages into actions
taken by a talek client to chat with remote contacts without revealing social
network information to servers.

A getting-started page is maintained [here](https://wills.co.tt/talirc).
